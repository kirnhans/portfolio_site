<p>Hello! I'm a Mathematics teacher for secondary school in New South Wales.</p>
<p>I was a software engineer for three years. As such, I know my way around computers and how to explain introductory programming. (As an undergrad, I led a seminar on algorithms for Year 8 girls.) My years in the industry further equip me to shed light on STEM careers for students.</p>
<p>I am also an avid cyclist and have completed two rides of 100km, known as Gran Fondos (unofficial). I am well-informed of several different pop culture fandoms, allowing me to connect with students in terms of media. I have studied behavioural interventions and am able to assist students with problem behaviour, with a varied knowledge of various counselling principles, such as mindfulness, dialectics, correcting cognitive distortions, self-regulation, etc. </p>
<p>I believe these skills place me well to be an asset to my students and my fellow staff members.</p>
