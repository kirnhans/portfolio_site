### 6.4.1 Demonstrate an understanding of the rationale for continued professional learning and implications for improved student learning

  

The nature of life is change and one of the greatest strengths of the human race is that we learn and adapt. (Csibra & Gergely, 2011). Learning also keeps the mind alive and quick. As the saying goes, "use it or lose it". (Shors et al., 2012).

  

As teachers, we can only convey beliefs that we hold ourselves. Modelling has long been recognised as an important teaching strategy. (Salisu & Ransom, 2014). To convey the importance of learning to students, we must cherish learning ourselves. I intend to model the freedom to say "I don’t know" and follow up with "but I’ll find out". Modelling a willingness to confront ignorance instead of hiding it is probably the most valuable skill I can impart to students.

  

Copious research shows that teacher’s learning improves student outcomes. (Meiers, 2007). This study mentions the great impact teachers have on student outcomes in general, so it stands to reason a teacher’s improvement in their practice advantages their students. Honestly for me, that's the whole point: to keep growing with the students.  Professional learning is a way to ensure that our improvement is a continued process, accruing benefit to our students.

  

This semester, I have learnt how many learning activities occur in the day-to-day of a teacher's work, an exciting contrast with my previous field. Learning can happen in many ways: individually, collaboratively, in a mentoring relationship, routinely, formally, etc. I reflect on several of these below.

  

Individually, reflection is an important ingredient of learning. I bought an attractive journal app this semester that has motivated me more than previous attempts at journalling. Additionally I allowed myself more flexibility in how I put my thoughts down, such as messaging myself ideas for improvement to be filed later, rather than requiring myself to use a particular section in the OneNote app or such. I’ve also discussed my experiences with friends, to explain my thoughts in a more coherent, comprehensible form than that required by a nonjudgmental piece of paper. I plan to continue these agile processes.

  

In Autumn 2021, we collaborated in working groups, where I found myself frustrated by communication difficulties. Some teammates were unresponsive and difficult to schedule with. By trying different communication styles, however, I realised that unspoken expectations were the source and presenting goals in a more accessible manner and asking clarifying questions were effective remedies.

  

I have both been mentored and mentored others. I found that, like feedback, advice was most helpful when it was targeted and actionable. As a teacher, I intend to solicit constructive feedback from my supervisor through specific questions, in order to maximise the improvements I can make. 

  
  

Learning expands a teacher’s toolkit. Much of the research I’ve read in my first M. Teach semester (some of which is cited in these essays) was written in the last twenty years. The field of teaching is growing like grass under our feet and we have a duty to grow with it.
