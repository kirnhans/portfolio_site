## Geometry
* [Pythagoras Theorem](https://betterexplained.com/articles/surprising-uses-of-the-pythagorean-theorem/): Intuition and Applications
* [Liquid Pythagoras Theorem](https://www.reddit.com/r/oddlysatisfying/comments/okry97/how_to_visually_prove_pythagoras_theorem_a%C2%B2_b%C2%B2_c%C2%B2/): Visual model of areas of right triangle sides

## Multiple Topics
* [Video tutorials, worked examples and exercises](https://corbettmaths.com/contents/)
	* Topics covered: geometry, algebra, stats (averages), decimals + lots more
	* Warning: Unsorted, long list
* [Supporting Australia Maths Project](https://www.amsi.org.au/ESA_middle_years/Year7/Year7_md/Year7main.html): Lesson Plans for Years 7-9
* [NSW Lesson Plans](https://education.nsw.gov.au/teaching-and-learning/curriculum/mathematics/mathematics-curriculum-resources-k-12/mathematics-7-10-resources): Fun out-of-the box activities for Years 7-10
* [Calculator based activities](https://education.ti.com/en-au/seniornspiredcurriculum/aus-nz/nsw)
	* Example: [this activity](https://education.ti.com/en-au/seniornspiredcurriculum/aus-nz/detail?id=0E575E989E17478696FCD9966760231E&t=4F3490A6B252453E9D603D8739C4309F#!) has students solve simultaneous equations to decide when to take a taxi vs. rideshare.
	* Note: These activities require a programmable calculator, which students may lack. [Wolfram-Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/) can provide an alternative to a handheld calculator for several of the activities.

## Old Faithfuls
* [Mathspace](https://help.mathspace.co/en/collections/93682-using-mathspace-as-a-teacher): needs no introduction, used in most classrooms, provides individual-targeted exercises digitally
	* I personally prefer Mathspace to [Education Perfect](https://www.educationperfect.com/), but to each their own
* [Kahoot!](https://kahoot.com/files/2021/06/StarterGuide_0621.pdf): in-class competitive topic quizzes
* [Freefall Mathematics](https://freefallmathematics.com/products.htm): worksheets and ebooks - many schools have a subscription
* [Blooket](https://www.blooket.com/): Similar to Kahoot!, it gamifies the quiz process. Works well as a Friday afternoon activity

## Miscellaneous
* [Four Card Permutation](https://www.geogebra.org/m/gmqatpq7): interactive (GeoGebra)
	* shows how permutations are limited by choices and thus intuition for the formula n!
* [Fraction drawing](https://apps.mathlearningcenter.org/fractions/): whiteboard for fractions, provides pie and rectangular shapes
	* Start with the information icon to the right (i), the interface is confusing without explanation
* [Place value columns](https://www.didax.com/apps/base-ten-blocks/): visual depiction of place value with blocks, mimicking a classical teaching prop for primary students
	* can be used to support numeracy
