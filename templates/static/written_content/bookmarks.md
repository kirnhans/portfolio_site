## Hooks
* [Transum](https://www.transum.org/Software/SW/Starter_of_the_day/index_page.asp) - This website is useful for starting lessons or, as breaks in between a lesson
![](static\images\bookmarks_screencaps\Transum.png)
	* My colleague Cindy highly recommends Countdown and Ancient Mysteries for lower ability classes
* [Which One Doesn't Belong?](https://wodb.ca/)
![](static\images\bookmarks_screencaps\wodb.png)
	* Each prompt features four objects (such as shapes or numbers)
	* Any of the four objects could be said to not belong, providing room for discussion
	* Encourages students to present mathematical arguments and demonstrate reasoning

## Exercises
* [Mathspace](https://help.mathspace.co/en/collections/93682-using-mathspace-as-a-teacher): needs no introduction, used in most classrooms, provides individual-targeted exercises digitally
	* I personally prefer Mathspace to [Education Perfect](https://www.educationperfect.com/), but to each their own
* [Freefall Mathematics](https://freefallmathematics.com/products.htm): worksheets and ebooks - many schools have a subscription

## Lesson Plans
* [Supporting Australia Maths Project](https://www.amsi.org.au/ESA_middle_years/Year7/Year7_md/Year7main.html): Lesson Plans for Years 7-9
![](static\images\bookmarks_screencaps\Supporting Australia Maths Project.png)
* [NSW Lesson Plans](https://education.nsw.gov.au/teaching-and-learning/curriculum/mathematics/mathematics-curriculum-resources-k-12/mathematics-7-10-resources): Fun out-of-the box activities for Years 7-10
![](static\images\bookmarks_screencaps\det_lesson_plans.png)
* [Texas Instruments activities](https://education.ti.com/en-au/seniornspiredcurriculum/aus-nz/nsw): Calculator based activities
![](static\images\bookmarks_screencaps\texas_instruments.png)
	* Example: [this activity](https://education.ti.com/en-au/seniornspiredcurriculum/aus-nz/detail?id=0E575E989E17478696FCD9966760231E&t=4F3490A6B252453E9D603D8739C4309F#!) has students solve simultaneous equations to decide when to take a taxi vs. rideshare.
	* Note: These activities require a programmable calculator, which students may lack. [Wolfram-Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/) can provide an alternative to a handheld calculator for several of the activities.

## Games
* [Combining Like Terms Uno](https://www.frontporchmath.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/like-terms-uno.pdf)
	* Algebra card-game
* [Blooket](https://www.blooket.com/): Similar to Kahoot!, it gamifies the quiz process. Works well as a Friday afternoon activity
	* My colleague Shaza recommends the crypto mode.
* [Kahoot!](https://kahoot.com/files/2021/06/StarterGuide_0621.pdf): in-class competitive topic quizzes

## Geometry
* [Pythagoras Theorem](https://betterexplained.com/articles/surprising-uses-of-the-pythagorean-theorem/): Intuition and Applications
* [Liquid Pythagoras Theorem](https://www.reddit.com/r/oddlysatisfying/comments/okry97/how_to_visually_prove_pythagoras_theorem_a%C2%B2_b%C2%B2_c%C2%B2/): Visual model of areas of right triangle sides
![Liquid Pythagoras](static\images\bookmarks_screencaps\Liquid_Pythagoras.png)
* [Grok Learning](https://groklearning.com/): Programming with Python
![](static\images\bookmarks_screencaps\Grok_Learning.png)
	* My colleague Alex recommends this resource with the following descriptors
	* It introduces programming for year 7 students
	* Can be easily integrated in the Measurement topic
	* One option is [python programming](https://groklearning.com/course/maths-yr7/), the [other option](https://groklearning.com/course/aca-dt-7-bk-geometry/) uses block-style click-and-drag programming.
	* Note: this is a paid resource but can be shared by the whole school, including coding activities and some courses used by the DT department

## Manipulatives
* [Four Card Permutation](https://www.geogebra.org/m/gmqatpq7): interactive (GeoGebra)
	* shows how permutations are limited by choices and thus intuition for the formula n!
* [Fraction drawing](https://apps.mathlearningcenter.org/fractions/): whiteboard for fractions, provides pie and rectangular shapes
	* Start with the information icon to the right (i), the interface is confusing without explanation
* [Place value columns](https://www.didax.com/apps/base-ten-blocks/): visual depiction of place value with blocks, mimicking a classical teaching prop for primary students
	* can be used to support numeracy
* [Polypad/Mathigon](https://polypad.amplify.com/): visualisations and interactive representations in geometry, algebra, fractions, probability etc.
	* My colleague Miriam has kindly provided [this tutorial video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14SAUnBjVfp5k7cplvOTcKvpCM5dhmJ_F/view?pli=1) on using [this worksheet](https://polypad.amplify.com/p/eIKVcVDDtYEB3g) as an example.


## Multiple Topics
* [Gerry Dear Resources for Maths Teachers](http://maths.gerrydear.id.au/)
![](static\images\bookmarks_screencaps\gerrydear.png)
	* My colleague Hui Min found this helpful when planning lessons and provided the following descriptions.
	* Contains PowerPoints for some topics in Stage 4 and 5
	* Good starting point and inspiration as to how to teach some topics
	* Particularly good are the transitions included and the design for student engagement
	* Recommended: order of operations, angles of elevation and depression, rates and prime and composites.
* [Corbett Maths](https://corbettmaths.com/contents/)
![](static\images\bookmarks_screencaps\Corbett_maths.png)
	* Video tutorials, worked examples and exercises
	* Topics covered: geometry, algebra, stats (averages), decimals + lots more
	* Warning: Unsorted, long list
* [Kyle Webb Maths Tasks](https://tasks.kylewebb.ca/) ![](static\images\bookmarks_screencaps\Kyle Webb Maths Tasks.png) and [BTC Curricular Math Task Sheet K-12](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-tJ2DzGJ0JXpmcRJoJxsVBA3d0_2ygxfjH3c1s2GqLM/edit#gid=427306543) ![](static\images\bookmarks_screencaps\BTC Curricular Math Task Sheet K-12.png)
	* Resources based on the pedagogy discussed in Peter Liljedahl's book, 'Building Thinking Classrooms in Mathematics'
	* Activities to teach mathematics through a more critical thinking lens.
	* These are aligned with Canadian and U.S. standards, so require a bit more searching.
