## Hooks
* [Transum](https://www.transum.org/Software/SW/Starter_of_the_day/index_page.asp) - This website is useful for starting lessons or, as breaks in between a lesson
![](static\images\bookmarks_screencaps\Transum.png)
	* My colleague Cindy highly recommends Countdown and Ancient Mysteries for lower ability classes
* [Which One Doesn't Belong?](https://wodb.ca/)
![](static\images\bookmarks_screencaps\wodb.png)
	* Each prompt features four objects (such as shapes or numbers)
	* Any of the four objects could be said to not belong, providing room for discussion
	* Encourages students to present mathematical arguments and demonstrate reasoning

## Exercises
* [Mathspace](https://help.mathspace.co/en/collections/93682-using-mathspace-as-a-teacher): needs no introduction, used in most classrooms, provides individual-targeted exercises digitally
![](static\images\bookmarks_screencaps\mathspace.png)
	* I personally prefer Mathspace to [Education Perfect](https://www.educationperfect.com/), but to each their own
* [Freefall Mathematics](https://freefallmathematics.com/products.htm): worksheets and ebooks - many schools have a subscription
![](static\images\bookmarks_screencaps\freefall_mathematics.png)
* [Numeracy Ninjas](https://www.numeracyninjas.org/): Practice questions for numeracy
![](static\images\bookmarks_screencaps\numeracy_ninjas.png)

* [Grok Learning](https://groklearning.com/): Programming with Python
![](static\images\bookmarks_screencaps\Grok_Learning.png)
	* My colleague Alex recommends this resource with the following descriptors
	* It introduces programming for year 7 students
	* Can be easily integrated in the Measurement topic
	* One option is [python programming](https://groklearning.com/course/maths-yr7/), the [other option](https://groklearning.com/course/aca-dt-7-bk-geometry/) uses block-style click-and-drag programming.
	* Note: this is a paid resource but can be shared by the whole school, including coding activities and some courses used by the DT department
<!-- * [Dance Dance Transversal](static/pdfs/others_resources/mtm_reunion/Cindy-DanceDanceTransversal-Angles-activity.pdf): Game for Angle relationships
	* Cindy made this activity to teach co-interior angles, corresponding angles, etc.

	* My colleague Cindy sent this link of resources based on the pedagogy discussed in Peter Liljedahl's book, 'Building Thinking Classrooms in Mathematics'
	* Activities to teach mathematics through a more critical thinking lens
	* These are aligned with Canadian and U.S. standards, so require a bit more searching.
	* Relatedly: Jojo Ayao provided [this powerpoint](static\pdfs\others_resources\mtm_reunion\11MAA_Lesson_1_BTC_script.pdf) using the Building Thinking Classrooms model.

 	* Encourages students to visualise concepts
 	* Paige found this activity sometimes better in competitions, and sometimes in discussions
* [Implicit Differentiation Worksheet](static\pdfs\others_resources\mtm_reunion\implicit_differentiation_worksheet.pdf)
	* Andrew Huang made this worksheet for his Extension 2 class, as a refresher for related rates/differential equations
