### 7.3.1: Understand strategies for working effectively, sensitively and confidently with parents/carers

  

There are significant benefits to parent involvement in their children’s education. When teachers reach out more often, parents learn how to help their children with school and also support the teachers to a greater extent (Epstein, 2010, p. 38). These results have been quantitatively measured in students’ standardised test results (Epstein, 1991). Clarke (2014) further lays out multiple ways in which parent involvement can impact a school, contributing to diversity in experience offered in the classroom and representation in local communities. 

  

On a practical level, actions speak louder than words. Parents investing time into their child's education demonstrates their prioritisation of education, which is likely to show in student attitude, as children often reflect the values their families espouse. Parents can also advocate for their children, allying with schools in safeguarding their interests against external factors. They will naturally be more invested when they understand what their children are learning. Therefore, as a teacher, I plan to keep parents informed of curriculum materials, possibly through means such as TIPS homework (Epstein, 2010, p. 506), which Epstein demonstrated to positively affect parent attitudes towards homework. I’m excited by another idea: that of writing notes for parents about what their children are doing well, not just badly. (Some of the ideas listed [here](https://www.teachthought.com/pedagogy/10-messages-every-teacher-send-parents/) are interesting for this approach.)

  

Parents can also provide assistance to students in crossing the Zone of Proximal Development (Palacios, González, & Moreno, 1992). They are able to provide one-on-one help to a greater degree than a teacher addressing the needs of many students. As such, I consider parents partners in education and aim to empower them, through effective communication. Clarke (2014) emphasises the responsibility of teachers to involve parents, as left alone, not all parents are readily able to participate, reflecting a class divide in privilege.To combat this, I intend to provide parents with clear access points to assisting their child and the resulting progress. By providing this access, I can ensure parents focus their efforts where they are more effective. Working parents have limited time and it is my responsibility to help them efficiently leverage their labours in supporting education.

  

Accessibility is also an important matter when dealing with parents. Each parent is going through unique circumstances and we cannot change anything but our approach. Parents, like their children, all have different needs. In software engineering, we study how to enable users with different physical abilities and skill levels. An analogous strategy is applicable to interacting with parents. For example, for parents without reliable transportation, meetings at the school may not be accessible. Most commonly, parents may speak different languages. I’ve witnessed this before in my secondary school in India, where many parents were fluent in Hindi rather than English. Being multilingual myself, I am positioned to adopt similar methods to communicating with parents as I would to help learners with English as an Additional Language and/or Dialect. 

  

It’s quite inspiring to think that we can empower parents to take a role in their children’s education, a core part of their lives. To involve carers, teachers must first understand where they are coming from. This includes research on the area surrounding the school and community values. The strategies for community outreach will be vastly different for a school in the city than a rural-based school, because the concerns of the carers are different. I’m looking forward to getting to know the environment of the school and equipping the resultant strategies into my toolkit as a teacher.
