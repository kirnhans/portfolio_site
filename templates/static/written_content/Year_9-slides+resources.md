# Year 9

## Algebraic Expressions and Equations
My slides for the whole chapter are [here](static\pdfs\my_resources\Slides\Year_9\Algebraic_Expressions.pdf). I largely used textbook exercises for this chapter.

* [Expanding Brackets Bingo](https://www.interactive-maths.com/expanding-single-brackets-qqi-bingo.html) (I recommend printing a few 3x3 grids for students to fill in)
* [Multi-Step Equations Maze](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Solving-Multi-Step-Equations-with-Fractions-Digital-Maze-Activity-5074613)
* [Crossnumber](https://www.tes.com/teaching-resource/algebra-forming-equations-crossnumber-6139332): like a crossword but equations. More complex, higher order thinking skills required. Needs much explanation when presenting to students.
* [Problem-Solving Activity](static\pdfs\my_resources\Activities\Yr 9 Dog-Kennel scaffolded Eq Problem-Solving.pdf): an activity I made to calculate dimensions etc. for a dog kennel using algebraic expressions
* [Changing the subject of Formulae](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Changing-subject-Rearranging-Formulae-Treasure-hunt-GREEN-Easy-999654): Scavenger Hunt where students find the next question based on the previous answer.


## Indices
My slides for the whole chapter are [here](static\pdfs\my_resources\Slides\Year_9\year9-indices-slides.pdf). I largely used textbook exercises for this chapter.

* [Diagnostic test](static\pdfs\my_resources\year-9-Diagnostic-Indices.pdf) that I put together
* [Index Notation Tarsia](static\pdfs\my_resources\Activities\indices-notation-tarsia.pdf)
* [Blooket revising first half of chapter](https://dashboard.blooket.com/set/683e299c46fe0cb8b31dd131)
* [Scientific Notation Tarsia](https://web.archive.org/web/20161229182934/https://dpsmsmath.wikispaces.com/file/view/1.06-scientificsquare.pdf)


## Miscellaneous
* My [slides](static\pdfs\my_resources\Slides\Year_9\year9-measurement.pdf) for the chapter of Length, Area and Volume
* [Introducing Complementary Probability](static\pdfs\my_resources\Slides\Year_9\complementary-probability-lesson-plan.pdf): this is very rough please don't judge
* [Income Tax Graph](https://www.geogebra.org/m/q59cepde), explaining marginal tax visually
