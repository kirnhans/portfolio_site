These are strategies I have used in the classroom, to support the safe, responsible and ethical use of resources and the formation of a supportive, focused environment.

* I hand the Do Now activity sheets out as students arrive. By having the question already presented on the screen, I provided a nonverbal cue to any latecomers. I circulate and remind them where to start. This quickly settles the class.

* I reinforce classroom expectations that students had previously been taught. This included paying attention during explanations and not interrupting or engaging in cross-talk, which ensured the clear delivery of content. I use popsicle sticks to choose students for answering questions, which reduced calling out. I actively halt any mockery of wrong answers.

* Additionally, the "popsicle stick" strategy increases attention to particular questions from the selected students. Talking through the worked example with the selected students allows a gradual release of responsibility in a "We Do" approach.

* At the beginning of whole class teaching time, I prompt students to open their booklets. I remind students of expectations that they take notes in their booklet during whole class teaching time and complete exercises during independent practice time. I circulate to support them in responsible, on-task behaviour. These strategies encourage the students to complete their classwork.

* In many classes, I use GeoGebra visualisations. I select them ahead of time and presented them myself on the projector, removing the need for students to open their own devices and possibly act in an irresponsible and off-task manner. This allows the use of an engaging resource, enhancing student engagement without any safety or responsibility concerns.

* I work examples on the board for explicitly teaching. In response to student confusion, I have adopted the approach of writing headings and using different colors, facilitating student reference later on. 

* I solve the worked examples by prompting selected students to indicate the next step. Based on their confidence and fluency, I give more or less verbal scaffolding in the prompting (i.e. I hint more or less heavily at the next step). For some topics, I extend the modelling to early exercise questions, as lower ability students may be confused when starting the independent work.

* I give students different methods for answering questions, such as writing in their notebook to show me and holding up fingers for numerical answers (I had a student with selective mutism). This encourages participation for shy students.

* Whenever I have students play a Blooket on school laptops, I remind students of expectations regarding responsible use of devices and monitored their usage during class time. I also use Blooketâ€™s function of preset names in order to avoid any students choosing inappropriate names. I supervise the issue and return of laptops at the beginning and end.

* During one class, I provided the students with a tarsia puzzle. I printed the activity and cut up the pieces ahead of time, removing the need for students to use scissors and thus any safety concerns involved. I outlined the procedure for completing the tarsia activity and instructed students on how to begin. I circulated and redirected students who were distracted from the activity. This ensured their responsible participation.

* To aid class transitions, I greet students at the door and directed them to form a line, calling everyone's attention before entry. For dismissal, I direct students to pack up and stand behind their seats, dismissing the quiet and ready columns first. This is a method I learnt from my mentor on placement.
